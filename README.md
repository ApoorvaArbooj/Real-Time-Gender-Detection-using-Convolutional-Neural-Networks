        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Early on, humans learn to distinguish one shape from another in such a way that it feels like we
were born with this ability. When we try to mimic this human capability using our 0-1 marvel
(machines), only then we realize the complexity of this and are left with nothing but awe for the
human brain. Machine learning in layman terms is machines imitating and adapting human like
behavior. The human like behavior that is expected of the machine is to ‘learn from experience’.
Image classification has become one of the key pilot use-cases for demonstrating machine
learning. It involves the extraction of information from an image and then associating the extracted
information to one or more class labels. Image classification within the machine learning domain
can be approached as a supervised learning task. Here, in this project we aim to use images of
humans and classify them based on gender (male or female). This classification is then further fed
to a function which will then choose product adverts targeting the end consumer. This ensures that
the target consumer is made aware of the product which in turn will increase the sales bringing in
revenue.

        <h2>Business problem</h2>
        <p>
            To increase the sales revenue, we need to devise a smart marketing strategy. Our aim is to
advertise our products in such a way that the target consumer is made aware of our products. At
the sales counter, we predict the gender of the person and display relevant products on the screen
behind the counter at the store.
